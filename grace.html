					<dt class="dt-heading">My Early Life & Achievements</dt>
					<dd>I was an American computer scientist and US Navy rear admiral.</dd>
					<dd>I was the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University.</dd>
					<dd>I created the first compiler named A-O for computer languages. </dd>
					<dd>My compiler was the precursor for the COBOL language.</dd>
					<dd>I became the first female recipient of the National Medal of Technology.</dd>
					<dd>Due to my influence, programmers use “if/thens” instead of 1s and 0s today.</dd>

					<dd>The naval ship USS Hopper was named in my honor.</dd>
					<dd>I am called Grandmother of Cobol, Amazing Grace.</dd>
					<dd>I inspired young people to learn to program.</dd>
					<dd>I was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</dd>
					<dd>At 79, I was the oldest serving officer in U.S Navy.</dd>

					<dt class="dt-heading">My Challenges</dt>
					<dd>In my work on the compiler, I had to ingeniously design "forward jumps" in a program that had yet to be written.</dd>
					<dd>After years of relentless effort, I spiraled into depression, alcoholism, and suicidal behavior.</dd>
					<dd>I was rejected by the U.S. Navy for reasons that I couldn’t change.</dd>
					<dd>I was deemed too short, too underweight, too old (37 years), and overqualified.</dd>

					<dt class="dt-heading">My Thoughts On Life</dt>
					<dd>A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for.</dd>
					<dd>It is often easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.</dd>
					<dd>You don't manage people; you manage things. You lead people.</dd>
					<dd>Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, "We've always done it this way." I try to fight that. That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counter-clockwise.</dd>
					<dd>To me programming is more than an important practical art. It is also a gigantic undertaking in the foundations of knowledge.</dd>
