					<dd>Feet, what do I need you for when I have wings to fly?</dd>
					<dd>I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone, because I am the person I know best.</dd>
					<dd>At the end of the day, we can endure much more than we think we can.</dd>
					<dd>Nothing is worth more than laughter. It is strength to laugh and to abandon oneself, to be light.</dd>
					<dd>I think that little by little Iâ€™ll be able to solve my problems and survive.</dd>
