					<dd>I am an activist, a pioneer in the civil rights movement, and a nurse aide.</dd>
					<dd>I was the first African American woman to refuse to move to the back of a bus, nine months before Rosa Parks did.</dd>
					<dd>When I was 15, I refused to move to the back of the bus and give up my seat to a white person.</dd>
					<dd>I was forcibly removed from the bus and arrested by two policemen and imprisoned. </dd>
					<dd>My case was dropped by civil rights campaigners because: I was pregnant with a child out of wedlock, I did not have 'good hair', and was not fair skinned.</dd>

					<dt class="dt-heading">My Achievements</dt>
					<dd>When I was young, we couldn't try on clothes in stores. You had to take a brown paper bag and draw a diagram of your foot and take it to the store.</dd>
					<dd>I was charged with disturbing the peace, violating segregation laws, and battering and assaulting a police officer.</dd>
					<dd>I am one of four women plaintiffs in Browder v. Gayle, the court case that successfully overturned bus segregation laws in Montgomery and Alabama.</dd>
					<dd>March 2 is named Claudette Colvin Day in Montgomery. </dd>

				<dl>
					<dt class="dt-heading">My Challenges</dt>
					<dd>I had difficulty finding and keeping work after my participation in the federal court case that overturned bus segregation.</dd>
					<dd>I was branded a troublemaker by many in my community.</dd>
					<dd>Furthermore, I withdrew from college and struggled in the local environment.</dd>
					<dd>Though I was a predecessor to the Montgomery bus boycott movement, my story was rarely told.</dd>
					<dd>NAACP believed that Rosa Parks would be a better figure since she was an adult, had a job,  had a middle-class appearance and felt she had the maturity to handle being at the center of a controversy.</dd>

					<dd>I knew then and I know now that, when it comes to justice, there is no easy way to get it. </dd>
					<dd>You can't sugarcoat it. You have to take a stand and say "This is not right."</dd>
					<dd>I felt like Sojourner Truth was pushing down on one shoulder and Harriet Tubman was pushing down on the otherâ€”saying, 'Sit down girl!'</dd>
					<dd>I just couldn't move. History had me glued to the seat.</dd>
					<dd>This is my constitutional right!</dd>
